        @OCM-EDU <br>
        We are a team of passionate developers who are willing to share their knowledge with the world. <br>
        Noam Mirjani & Ariel Amon<br>
        We are computer Science Students in our 3rd year of studies. This project is a part of our course "Web Development".
        This Website is a platform for students to register courses and learn different subjects.
        There is possibility to add new courses and edit existing ones by the admin and to register to courses by the students.
        The website is built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, and MySQL by PHP.Admin.<br>
        We hope you enjoy our website!
